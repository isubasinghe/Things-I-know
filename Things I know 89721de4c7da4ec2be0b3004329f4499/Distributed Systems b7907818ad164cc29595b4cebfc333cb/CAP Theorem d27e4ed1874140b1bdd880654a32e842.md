# CAP Theorem

CAP Theorem asserts that you can only have two of the three, Consistency, Availability or Partition tolerance. However, Partition tolerance must be in place, we do not have the choice to drop Partition tolerance.

But interestingly, this isn't always the case, if you drop support for update operations, it is possible to have all three!!
